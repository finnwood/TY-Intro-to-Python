##  Replit Window

The main parts of the Replit Window A. The list of the files in the Repl. the file called main.py must be there as this is what is run. B. Then the main coding window. This is where the code is placed C. The console window is where the output of the program goes.

## First Python Code

### Characters

A character is any single item that can be printed to the screen. This can be letters, Numbers, or any other symbol the computer can display. Characters must be surrounded by ‚Äú ‚Äù or it will not display properly

### Strings

A string is any collection of 2 or more characters in a row. For Example, this sentence is a string made up of letters, Spaces and symbols such as the comma and full stop.

### Functions

A function is what a command is known as in Python. For Example, the function to place text on to the screen is the print command and is structured as follows

```python
print(‚ÄúThis is the print command‚Äù)
```

This will place the sentence *This is the print command* to the screen.

Note the structure of the brackets and inverted commas to print a string to the screen.
