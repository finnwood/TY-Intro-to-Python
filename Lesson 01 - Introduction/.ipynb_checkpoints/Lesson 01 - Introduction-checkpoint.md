## Creating First Repil
1.	Under Template start typing python and choose Python as the template
2.	It is important to give the Repl a recognisable name
3.	finally click on the Blue Create Rep## Replit Window
The main parts of the Replit Window A. The list of the files in the Repl. the file called main.py must be there as this is what is run. B. Then the main coding window. This is where the code is placed C. The console window is where the output of the program goes.
## First Python Code
CHARACTERS
A character is any single item that can be printed to the screen. This can be letters, Numbers, or any other symbol the computer can display. Characters must be surrounded by ‚Äú ‚Äù or it will not display properl
S
STRINGS
A string is any collection of 2 or more characters in a row. For Example, this sentence is a string made up of letters, Spaces and symbols such as the comma and full st

> print("This is the print Command")

This will place the sentence This is the print command to the screen.
Note the structure of the brackets and inverted commas to print a string to the screen.## Practice Code
